                Both technology and customers have revolved a lot over the last
                decade. Now, business owners have realized the fact that their
                <br class="br" />websites should advance with the passing time and not
                fall behind. And thus, we ensure the fact that all our clients stand

                    We, being experts in this field, strongly advise our clients to
                    place Calls-to-Action strategically. These are placed to encourage
                    the users to take steps to fulfil their goals. If your main goal is
                    to drive more visitors to your website to buy a product or service,
                    then it’s called a macro conversion. However, if your goal is to
                    make a lead download or sign up for your newspaper, then it’s called
                    micro-conversions. We understand our client’s requirements in detail

                    It’s still hard to believe that there are many non-responsive

                    report facing issues while using a static website. And when your
                    website isn’t responsive, this means that people using smartphones,
                    tablets, laptops or PCs may not be able to view the website as it
                    is. And with an increase in gadget users, it is vital that you opt

                    mainly focus on offering responsive website design.

                    The main concern of every website owner is to attract many visitors.
                    Besides generating enough traffic from social media platforms and
                    other websites, it is equally important that search engines send
                    enough organic traffic to the website too. If your site is ranking
                    higher on search engines, this means that your website is gaining
                    more exposure. We believe that every web designer should have an
                    understanding of SEO as well. This way, your site will be built on
                    the foundation of best SEO practices. We have in-depth knowledge of
                    SEO and we use the right set of keywords in specific website headers
                    and text areas so that the bots identify them and rank them
                    according to their relevance.

                    What’s that thing that makes your brand unique? Remember that your
                    website is your business’s online brochure, and it is vital that the
                    design remains consistent with all the efforts you’re putting in. We
                    ensure the fact that all your design elements flow smoothly on the
                    website and make sense. Check if the logo is not outdated and if it
                    is, consider its redesigning. Also, see to it that all the colors,
                    fonts, and styles attract visitors to the website.

                    Having an engaging and content-rich website won’t drive a good
                    amount of traffic to your website if your site loads slowly and your
                    visitors consider switching to another result. Thus, it is important
                    that you optimize all the elements of your website and reduce the
                    gap between click and loading of the website. For example, you can
                    start with optimizing all the images of the website as it maintains
                    a balance between speed and quality. Additionally, compress all the
                    files hosted on your website. Los Angeles web design agency keeps
                    all the factors in mind while designing a website so that the

                Most of the time, businesses (especially small-scale businesses) make
                certain mistakes while on the way of designing a website. In the
                <br class="br" />longer run, it’ll cost you more than you’ll ever
                imagine. We, at Baymedia Soft, ensure that the businesses who come
                here by us do not <br class="br" />commit the same mistakes as people
                do.

                    <strong>1. Choosing Cheap Web Design:</strong> One of the most
                    common mistakes that small-scale businesses make is going with a
                    cheap website design. Usually, these types of websites are quite
                    unprofessional and are difficult for the users to understand. In an
                    attempt to save money,they often create websites that do not serve
                    any purpose. And often, they’ll have to redesign and redevelop the
                    website with the help of a professional website design company Los
                    Angeles.

                <p class="para">
                    <strong>2. Using Stock or Low-Quality Images:</strong> No doubt,
                    stock photography can be of great help but there are numerous
                    websites that use the same cliché images. Feel free to use those
                    images but stay away from cliché images! Additionally, keep in mind
                    that you shouldn’t use low- images. Doing so will put an indication
                    to the potential customers that you’re not professional and will not
                    be able to meet the needs and requirements of your future clientele.
                    We always upload high-quality images while designing the site and,
                    on the other hand, we don’t compromise on the speed of the website.
                    That’s what matters the most!

                    <strong>3. Not Considering Their Target Audience:</strong> There are
                    many web designers that do not put the target audience as their
                    priority. These web designs are either way too unprofessional or too
                    simplistic and these leave their target audience back. For a
                    business owner, having an unprofessional and simplistic website may
                    sound detrimental to you. Also, a website with fewer visitors may
                    not help in ranking the customers. We, the web design company Los
                    Angeles, always follow a thumb rule while creating a site: always
                    keep your target audience as your priority.

                    <strong>4. Not Prioritizing on Easy-To-Use Navigation:</strong>
                    Skipping the essential step of not prioritizing navigation and
                    accessibility, is one of the deadliest mistakes people make. One of
                    the prominent mistakes that come under this is the poor menu and
                    navigation layout. If your website has an improper navigational
                    structure, then it can drive away all your visitors. And chances are
                    that you would be losing a great number of leads or conversions by
                    doing so. For instance, you want to design a website with many
                    sub-pages. In this case, if you arrange them into correct categories
                    and arrange them hierarchically, then it will navigate the users
                    properly and will enhance the user experience on the website.

                <p class="para">
                    <strong>5. Not Paying Enough Attention To 404 Pages:</strong> The
                    web designing process is not just limited to developing the design
                    layouts. Web design is further extended to incorporating great
                    content on a webpage and utilizing SEO tactics. If we talk about SEO
                    point-of-view, then one of the common mistakes unprofessional web
                    designers commit is that they do not pay attention to 404 pages.
                    Know that broken links or 404 pages on the website can harm a
                    business’s website. The visitors feel that either the website is a
                    fraud or their product or services are not up to the mark. To fix
                    this issue, you may opt out of using 301 or 302 redirects to some
                    other similar page on the web.

                        For instance, you’ve just opened an ice cream store on the main road. Visitors passing by will
                        see your store and drop in. Now, consider if your store is on a back road, you’re unlikely to
                        get visitors to your store. And even if you have an appealing website, it will all be a waste of
                        time and money if people don’t find you on search engine result pages. This is where SEO comes
                        in. It is a process that is followed to improve the ranking of a particular website for a

                        “Responsive Web Design” is the new approach to web design nowadays. This has been in this
                        industry for the past few years now but still, many businesses lack this feature. Responsive web
                        design makes it easier for one to view your website on different screens and sizes. This is
                        especially important for enhancing the user experience of the visitors. Additionally, Google’s
                        search algorithms are now favoring responsive websites. They rank the websites higher that are
                        responsive and run perfectly on all devices and screens.

                        A web designer’s job doesn’t end with only well-structured layouts. After designing the
                        website’s layout, we work on UX writing as well. Our main focus is to ensure that your contact
                        is transparent with the users. We include all the details that you offer to your visitors. Also,
                        instead of blindly following the norms, we conduct generous research about the customers you are
                        targeting. Lastly, we do not design an interface that outcasts poor-quality images and language.

                        One of the quickest and easiest ways of enhancing the user experience is to utilize the
                        whitespace generously. Do not over include the content on your webpage, let all the elements and
                        designs breathe and look polished. Here are some ways we use white space to boost the user
                        experience of the website:
                        The line space in between the text must be increased.
                        The white space in between the long text blocks must be increased on the left and right margins.
                        Avoid placing images in line with the content. Instead, place them on top or under text blocks.

                        will also cost you enough as you’ll lose business. Most websites are built using DIY ways and
